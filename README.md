# Dermai: Skin Cancer Detection Tool

> 🏆 Winner: MLH Best AI Project with Databricks Open Source @ Knight Hacks VII

## 📖 Overview - https://devpost.com/software/dermai-mtogh3
Dermai is a mobile application that raises awareness about skin cancer by providing an accessible AI-powered early-detection tool. Users can capture or upload an image of a skin lesion, and our AI model analyzes it to detect potential signs of skin cancer, giving immediate feedback.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload or capture images of skin lesions directly in the app  
- AI-powered image analysis with real-time feedback  
- Lightweight, responsive mobile experience  
- State-of-the-art image-classification techniques

## 🛠️ Built With
- **React Native** & **TypeScript** (mobile frontend)  
- **TensorFlow** & **Keras** (AI model)  
- Client-side prediction logic optimized for mobile

## 🧩 Architecture
1. **Frontend**  
   - React Native app for iOS and Android  
2. **Model**  
   - Pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model packaged with the app  
3. **Integration**  
   - Client-side inference for low latency and offline support

## 🧗 Challenges
- Keeping the AI model small and fast without sacrificing accuracy  
- Integrating TensorFlow/Keras with React Native  
- Balancing UX and performance on diverse devices

## 🏆 Accomplishments
- Delivered a fully functional mobile app with embedded AI analysis  
- Trained a robust image-classification model for skin-lesion detection  
- Created an intuitive, accessible user interface  
- Recognized as **Best AI Project** at Knight Hacks VII

## 📚 What We Learned
